**Dal Makhani** is more than just a dish — it's a slow-cooked testament to the richness of Punjabi cuisine. Made from whole black lentils (urad dal) and kidney beans (rajma), simmered gently with butter, cream, and subtle spices, this dish transforms humble ingredients into something deeply luxurious.

Traditionally cooked overnight in clay pots, Dal Makhani develops a smoky, velvety texture that pairs perfectly with naan or jeera rice. Its name — Makhani, meaning “buttery” — hints at the indulgence within every spoonful.

Though rooted in the kitchens of Punjab, Dal Makhani has become a cherished staple in Indian celebrations, restaurant menus, and homes worldwide.

Creamy. Earthy. Timeless. Dal Makhani isn’t just food — it’s a warm memory in the making.
