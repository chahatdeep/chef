### 👨‍🍳 Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Mangoes**  
   Wash mangoes well and pat dry completely. Cut into small cubes. Spread on a clean cloth and sun-dry for a few hours to remove excess moisture.

2. **Prepare the Spices**  
   Dry roast fenugreek seeds until aromatic. Let cool, then coarsely grind with mustard seeds.  
   In a bowl, mix all dry spices: ground fenugreek+mustard, fennel, ajwain, kalonji, turmeric, red chili powder, hing, and salt.

3. **Mix with Mangoes**  
   In a large bowl, add the mango pieces and prepared spice mix. Toss well so that all pieces are evenly coated.

4. **Add Oil**  
   Heat mustard oil to smoking point, then cool completely. Pour cooled oil over the spiced mangoes until fully covered.

5. **Jar & Rest**  
   Transfer to a clean, dry glass jar. Cover with a cotton cloth or loose lid. Let it rest at room temperature for 3–5 days, shaking daily.

### 💡 Tips:

- Ensure mangoes and utensils are completely dry to avoid spoilage.  
- Use mustard oil generously to cover the mangoes — this acts as a preservative.  
- Adjust chili and salt to taste.  
- Skip garlic — this version is garlic-free and lighter.  
- Store in a cool, dry place. Keeps for months if submerged in oil.
