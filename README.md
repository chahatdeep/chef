Welcome to **Chahat Singh's** curated list of recipes, a beautifully curated collection of traditional and regional recipes brought to life with elegance and clarity. This project is a personal endeavor to collect, recreate, and share authentic dishes — from pickles to pasta — each with its own story. 

🧭 Whether you're exploring Indian classics like *Aam ka Achaar* and *Dal Makhani*, or venturing into Italian simplicity with *Spaghetti Aglio e Olio*, this site is designed to be lightweight, mobile-friendly, and truly delicious.

## 🍲 Preserving Culinary Heritage
This website is a tribute to the timeless flavors of homemade cooking — a digital recipe box crafted to preserve dishes that often fade with time. Because sometimes, the greatest food doesn’t come from famous kitchens, but from small homes, passed down quietly through generations. 
Let these recipes live on — now, and forever.
