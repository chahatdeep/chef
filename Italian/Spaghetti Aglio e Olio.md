## 👨‍🍳 Method

1. **Cook the Pasta**  
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining.

2. **Prepare the Sauce**  
   In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and chopped chili. Sauté gently until the garlic is golden and fragrant, being careful not to burn it.

3. **Combine Pasta and Sauce**  
   Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet. Toss to coat the pasta with the garlic-chili oil. If the mixture seems dry, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.

4. **Serve**  
   Plate the pasta and garnish with chopped fresh parsley. If desired, sprinkle with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Serve immediately.
